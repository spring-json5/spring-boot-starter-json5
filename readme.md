---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3+**

---

### Installation

Add the starter as a dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.spring-json5</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-json5</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The starter will be activated automatically in your Spring Boot project using Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.

---

### Usage

#### 1. REST Controllers

Since you added the starter to your pom.xml, no need for additional setup.
Provide request header `Accept: appication/json5` to receive response body in JSON5 format.
And in the same manner provide request header `Content-Type: appication/json5` with body in JSON5 format if you want your controller be able to deserialize JSON5 request body to your object in controller.

#### 2. RestTemplate

Use class `Json5RestTemplate` on order to make requests and get responses in JSON5 format.
The class 100% compatible with original `RestTemplate` because it is just extend it.
By default `Json5RestTemplate` able to serialize and deserialize with JSON5, but you should provide `Content-Type: application/json5` header and/or `Accept: application/json5` header if you want to force this behavior.
If you want ot avoid every time manually provide headers, you can use contractor with parameters `new Json5RestTemplate(USE_ONLY_JSON5_CONTENT_TYPE, USE_ONLY_JSON5_ACCEPT);`

#### 3. JsonMapper

Use class `Json5Mapper` on order to serialize/deserialize objects from/to JSON5 format.
The class 100% compatible with original Jackson `JsonMapper` because it is just extending it and construct with a bunch of settings that allow JSON5 format support.
Moreover, you can use static method `Json5Mapper.build()` if you want to get vanilla JsonMapper object that able work with JSON5.
