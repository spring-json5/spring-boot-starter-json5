```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.spring-json5</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-json5</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

---

### Usage

#### 1. For REST endpoints.

Since you added the starter to your pom.xml, no need for additional setup.
Provide request header `Accept: appication/json5` to receive response body in JSON5 format.
And in the same manner provide request header `Content-Type: appication/json5` with body in JSON5 format if you want your controller be able to deserialize JSON5 request body to your object in controller.

#### 2. Other

Use class `Json5Mapper` on order to serialize/deserialize objects from/to JSON5 format.
The class 100% compatible with original Jackson `JsonMapper` because it is just extend it.
Moreover, you can use static method `Json5Mapper.build()` if you want to get vanilla JsonMapper object that able work with JSON5.
